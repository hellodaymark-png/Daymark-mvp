# Daymark UI Monetization Philosophy

## Core Principle

Daymark is a situational awareness platform.

Monetization must support risk reduction — not distract from it.

Trust > Revenue  
Clarity > Clicks  
Mitigation > Marketing  

---

## Positioning

Daymark does not "sell products."

Daymark provides:
- Signal detection
- Risk interpretation
- Exposure reduction guidance

Product suggestions are secondary to actionable mitigation steps.

---

## Monetization Model (Phase 1 – Affiliate, Contextual Only)

Affiliate recommendations will:

- Appear only when a signal threshold is met
- Be hidden by default (expandable)
- Follow mitigation guidance
- Include only ONE suggested tool
- Avoid pricing, urgency language, or promotional styling
- Include a minimal disclosure line

Example flow:

Signal Card  
↓  
Expandable Section: "Reduce Exposure"  
↓  
Immediate Actions (3 bullets max)  
↓  
Thin divider  
↓  
Suggested Tool  
↓  
Subtle affiliate disclosure

## UI Behavior Rules

1. No banner ads.
2. No pop-ups.
3. No flashing elements.
4. No countdown timers.
5. No aggressive calls-to-action.
6. One suggestion per signal maximum.
7. No product shown if signal conditions are normal.

If the day is calm, no product appears.

## Design Language

- Minimalist
- Swiss-inspired typography
- Soft gray cards
- Rounded edges
- Clean spacing
- Neutral tone
- Calm color accents

The product suggestion should visually feel like guidance — not commerce.

---

## Disclosure Standard

All affiliate links must include:

"Daymark may earn from qualifying purchases."

Small font.
Muted color.
No emphasis.

---

## Long-Term Vision (Phase 2+)

Future evolution may include:

- "Preparedness Insight" labeling
- Curated Daymark-recommended kits
- Signal-aligned brand partnerships
- Premium tier with no product suggestions
- Data-layer monetization (B2B)

However:

The integrity of the signal experience must never be compromised.

---

## Guardrail Rule

If monetization ever:

- Reduces clarity
- Slows load time
- Distracts from signal interpretation
- Feels sales-driven

It should be removed or redesigned.

---

## Strategic Intent

Daymark monetization should reinforce the brand identity:

"We detect disruption. We help reduce exposure."

Not:

"We drive product clicks."
